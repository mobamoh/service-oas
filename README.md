## Description
This repository is an alternative implementation of the Ardan Labs Service Repository, inspired by Bill Kennedy's 
Ultimate Software Design with Kubernetes course. It combines the architectural principles and design guidelines 
from the original project with the contract-first development approach 
using OpenAPI Specification and the [Ogen](https://github.com/ogen-go/ogen) tool for server stub generation.

## Motivation
In many modern organizations, contract-first development plays a pivotal role in software design. 
By defining an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) as the contract between various stakeholders—such as frontend and 
backend teams, external integrators, or microservices—it becomes possible to achieve:

- **Improved collaboration**: Clear API definitions that act as a source of truth.
- **Faster development**: Automated code generation for client and server stubs.
- **Stronger alignment**: Ensuring teams agree on API expectations upfront.

This project showcases how to integrate contract-first principles into a service implementation while adhering 
to the proven Go-based, highly scalable, and maintainable design patterns taught in the course.

## Why Use This Repo?
This implementation is ideal for developers who:

- Want to learn or apply contract-first development using OpenAPI and Go.
- Appreciate the structured approach to service design taught by Ardan Labs.
- Seek a contract-first api development alternative to the original service repo for real-world scenarios.
